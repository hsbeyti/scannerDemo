testscanner
===========



This project folder contains all files needed for the project ScannerDemo :
bashScripts: all necessary scripts to start and stop docker containers on the server (deployments)
docker-compose: to create one container of the scannerDemo Image
node-red-source: contains the node red file needed : flow.json, flow_cred.json and settings.js

How to operate?

It communicates with the CPU using OPC UA protocol, it acts as an UPC UA client.
1- first you move to scannerDemo folder (on the deployment server, for the first time create a new one)
2- you need to pull into this folder the corresponding docker image form the docker-hub cloud repository  "hsbeyti/indaus", type the command "sudo docker pull hsbeyti/indaus:observer1.x" 
you need also to have the following files in this folder:
docker-compose.yml
startAll.bash
stopAll.bash
removeAll.bash
reStartAll.bash
configDocker

3- write in the config  text file "configDocker" the IP add addresses of the CPU you want to communicate with see below is an example:
192.168.33.20
192.168.33.80
192.168.33.90
192.168.33.100

4- type the following command "./startAll configDocker", this will create a new container for each IP address line of the file "configDocker"
 
It uses the follwing virtual drive on the host:
volumes:
  mysqldockerimage_gittersDB:/var/lib/mysql
    external: true

and it uses the "bridgeAll" to communicates with other conatienrs suche msql and othe rconatiners of the smae image
networks:
  mysql-bridge:
    name: bridgeAll
    driver: bridge
excel file wird in diesem folder 
from any browser now you can access all containers using server IP:port/ui
